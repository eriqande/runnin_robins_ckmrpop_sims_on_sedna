README: CKMRpop runs with corrected sib counting
================

## GitHub Documents

Robin discovered a bug in some of his code and so wanted to re-run some
of the simulations. Everything to do so is contained in this directory,
`RobinsUpdatedSibCountingCode`.

He only needed the really large sizes re-done. I took his updated code
and inserted it into the scheme I had originally made for parallelizing
the runs so I could run it quickly on the cluster.

To launch this on the cluster, you must have Snakemake in your
environment. From the directory in which this README resides you then
do:

``` sh
```
