## GitHub Documents

Robin discovered a bug in some of his code and so wanted to re-run some of the
simulations.  Everything to do so is contained in this directory,
`RobinsUpdatedSibCountingCode`.  

He only needed the really large sizes re-done.  I took his updated code and
inserted it into the scheme I had originally made for parallelizing the runs
so I could run it quickly on the cluster.

To launch this on the cluster, you must have Snakemake in your environment.  From
the directory in which this README resides I did this:
```sh
snakemake --use-envmodules --profile ../slurm_runnin_robin  --jobs 400
```
